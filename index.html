        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Haileybury is one of the leading independent schools in the Asia-Pacific region with campuses in Keysborough, Brighton, Berwick, Melbourne (City), Darwin and Beijing. The School is acclaimed for its outstanding academic achievements, small class sizes, broad range of co-curricular activities, and state-of-the-art facilities. Learning is based on the different learning styles of students, and on their gender, age, interests and potential.


            The Berwick campus located on High Street has modern facilities and beautiful, spacious surroundings. The campus features an assembly and concert hall, indoor pool, a library and resource centre, multiple computer laboratories, four playing fields, six tennis and basketball courts, and a fully-equipped sports hall.

            The Haileybury Junior School Program has a strong focus on literacy and numeracy, which are the foundation schools off all learning at one of Berwick's top primary schools.

            As part of the parallel education model boys and girls learn separately in the middle and senior years. The Edrington Girls Middle School caters specifically to the Years 5 to 8 girls and provides them with a calming and engaging space that is their own. The separate learning areas create structure where the particular needs of pre-adolescent and adolescent girls can be met. During recess and lunchtimes boys and girls have the opportunity to mix and socialise in the common areas.

        <h1>A WELCOME FROM THE PRINCIPAL</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
    <p>Haileybury is acclaimed as a great world school.

The acclaim stems from our remarkable academic results achieved through the highly successful parallel education model, outstanding teachers, small class sizes and an unmatched level of individual attention – and over 125 years of history and achievement.

Haileybury was named Australian School of the Year at the 2018 Australian Education Awards and ranked by the Australian as the number one primary school for boys and girls in Victoria and the number two secondary school based on national academic testing results.

Haileybury has high expectations for its students and teachers. In the Senior School, we expect that 45% of boys and girls should be placed in the top 10% in Australia, 75% in the top 20% in the country and 90% should be in the top 30%.

We believe that graduating students should have strong core academic skills, a broad analytical thinking ability and be capable of operating in a rapidly changing world. Haileybury offers a wide range of international engagement opportunities for students from Melbourne including spending time at the Haileybury International School, Tianjin (China) or visiting partner schools in Timor Leste, The Philippines, Japan, France, the UK and the US.

At Haileybury learning starts at an early age through flexible and creative programs in our Early Learning Centres. The core literacy and numeracy skills are developed through the use of explicit, direct instructional learning in the Junior Years. In the Middle Years a combination of explicit instruction and student-centred learning is used to broaden analytical thinking and problem solving. An exciting Year 9 development program develops independence and resilience. The three-year VCE Program in the Senior Years, coupled with a wide range of subject choices available, ensures that there are programs to suit all students' interests and abilities.

Our academic programs are enhanced by Haileybury's commitment to a strong social education program that includes fulfilling potential, supporting individual resilience and the development of personal character values. I believe in the principles of social justice and am committed to the School developing our students accordingly.

Haileybury is one of the most entrepreneurial and enterprising schools in Australia. The development of Melbourne’s first vertical school, extensive operations in China and the opening of Haileybury Rendall School Darwin are all examples of this. In 2017 Haileybury became the first Australian school to have students launch an experiment on to the International Space Station. To be a Haileybury student is to be immersed in an enterprising institution.

We look forward to showing you our School - an institution of which we are very proud.

            <p class="text-muted text-left">Swimming is a key sport for our pupils both from a competitive and also a well-being perspective, and is an option year round for all our year groups.
We have a 25m indoor pool with six lanes and the pool is lifeguarded throughout the week.  The weekly programme includes both free swim opportunities for all, as well as nine windows for our performance squad to train for competitions.

Coaches include Sandy Blampied, a highly-experienced coach who has competed at the top level in South Africa, and Kate Liddiard (Level 2 coach) who also runs the Triathlon Squad.

Our girls’ freestyle relay squad made it into the national top 10 in the Bath Cup in 2019 and the young talent coming through is extremely exciting. We take part in both school galas, as well as the ESSA competitions and the Hertfordshire Schools’ League.

            <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize">the most famous hall in haileybury edrington</h5>

            <p class="text-muted text-left">The John twist hall holds so many activities such as music, drama and dance here is some information about them. The Dance Program at Haileybury is vast and varied with students able to participate in dance from Prep through to Year 12 in many different ways. An after-school dance program is offered as an optional extra for Prep to Year 6 students across all campuses. Dance classes incorporate a variety of styles depending on the experience and interest of the students. Students build technique whilst having lots of fun and build routines for competition (Grades 5 and 6 students only) and the end of year Dance Gala. From Year 7 through to Year 12 Dance is part of the sport program and students can elect to participate in Dance as their chosen summer and winter sport. The selection process is based on audition and students who successfully make it into the Middle School and Senior School Dance Teams train twice weekly with an experienced coach and choreographer building a routine for competition. Students who are passionate and skilled dancers can also elect to study Dance at VCE by completing Units 1 to 4 in Dance. Students study prescribed works by well-known choreographers, learn dance works and develop their own solos for assessment as part of this course. Finally, there are many opportunities for students to be involved in Dance at a co-curricular level from Junior School through to Senior School by way of school musicals or the bi-annual Tattoo. Haileybury is acclaimed for the quality of its dramatic performances. Drama is part of the curriculum from the Early Learning Centre to Year 12.

             The co-curricular component is largely based around productions such as plays, musicals and variety shows.  Music and drama productions commence in Middle School. 

For more information about Drama at Haileybury, please contact the Director of Visual and Performing Arts via the Directory. aileybury offers many choral and instrumental ensembles at all campuses for all levels, ages and ability. 
Once a student has reached a basic level of proficiency they will be ready to join an appropriate core 
ensemble under the guidance of our experienced staff.
Access to this valuable program is included in the instrumental music lesson fee. Participation in the 
ensemble program is a requirement of learning an instrument at school. Students who learn a musical 
instrument outside the School are also welcome to participate in the ensemble program. So that was just a bit about what goes on in John twist hall.</p>

These extraordinary results are a testament to our students’ commitment, work ethic and to brilliant teaching. They place Haileybury at the top of performances by Victorian and Australian schools.

Haileybury is an open entry school and the achievement of 94% of all students in the top 40% in Australia is an excellent reflection of our commitment to every student. Our School motto that “Every student matters every day” is being lived and is reflected in students having the opportunity and the support to reach their potential.

            <p>Exceptional pre-school programs and highly engaged children have seen Haileybury’s Early Learning Centres (ELCs) recognised by the State Government.

Our innovative program combines learning, inclusion, and sustainability with the need to have fun in a nurturing environment as children start their education journey.

The leadership team bases its approach to learning on what children know now and are ready to learn next, using evidence-based practices to inform teaching and measure its impact.

This ensures impressive learning outcomes and has seen our team awarded The Emeritus Professor Collette Tayler Excellence in Educational Leadership Award by the Victorian Department of Education and Training.

Part of the 2020 Victorian Early Years Awards, it recognises a program that has led educators and teachers to significantly improve the quality of their learning and teaching practices, with a focus on improved outcomes for Victorian children and their families.

Minister for Early Childhood Ingrid Stitt shared a congratulatory message with winners:

“Congratulations to the winners of this year’s Victorian Early Years Awards for their contribution to improving outcomes for Victorian children and their families…These winners are leaders in the early childhood sector, exemplifying the hard work and dedication to provide the best opportunities and educational outcomes for children in the Education State.”</p>

            <p>Our Junior Schools were already acclaimed for innovations such as the Explicit Teaching Model, which we share with over 100 schools nationally through the Haileybury Institute.

We also pioneered the Parallel Education Model, which allows boys and girls to learn together in their younger years, and then separately in most classes from Year 5.

Judges praised Haileybury’s primary program for its consistent high standards, extensive extra-curricular programs, student data and balanced approach to the whole child.

CEO | Principal Derek Scott says the award reflects Haileybury’s innovation, outstanding programs, exceptional staff, and global vision, which saw it shine during online learning due to COVID-19.

“Our primary programs provide the strongest possible foundation and came into their own in 2020, ensuring that students maintained their high standards during the pandemic,” Derek says.

From Day 1, Haileybury nurtures excellence through individually tailored primary programs that support pupils in having fun, building resilience, and thriving academically and personally.

Each Haileybury child is valued across all aspects of the curriculum, making Inquiry, wellbeing, Science, Art, Music, Drama, CDT, Chinese, PE, Sport and Library important.

Students learn in an atmosphere of trust, mutual respect, and strong pastoral care. Teaching programs meet their individual needs and interests, while developing self-esteem and confidence.

Social justice is also promoted from a young age through a range of community-based opportunities.

The Primary School Curriculum Team works across four Melbourne campuses to create a program consistent across the School. The same concepts are taught at each year level, based on moderation documents that specify high standards and benchmarks.

Regular modelling, coaching and weekly teaching and learning meetings ensure that teachers uniformly deliver the Explicit Teaching Model.

All of this is managed while adhering to our guiding ethos that ‘every student matters every day’ and ensuring that parents and carers are genuine education partners.

Technology and entrepreneurship are also a focus, through programs such as HaileyburyX, to ensure that students will be ready for a constantly changing world.

To do all this, we need the best teachers. Haileybury celebrates excellence in teaching by hiring talented staff and providing them with leading professional learning opportunities.

It all adds up to an unparalleled learning environment, consistently high NAPLAN results and the best possible start for our students.

        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" > A child’s first few years are a time of wonder, bonding and curiosity. However, it’s never too early to instill in them a love of reading. Reading to your child from birth will help develop their language and literacy skills, not to mention their cerebral development.


Children starting school with greater literacy skills perform better in school, and these skills can be enhanced activities like music, dance, storytelling, visual arts and drama.

            
            Suggested activities

Read together, visit the library, and attend story time sessions.
Make the most of screen time; discuss TV shows and play educational games together.
Outings to the zoo, shops, museums, libraries and galleries.
Share rhymes, poems and songs. Encourage your child to join in.
Share and talk about family histories and family photos.
Look at picture or art books. Ask your child to describe what is happening and make up stories together.
Collect cardboard and other household items for your child to build with and ask them to describe what they are building.
Look at ‘junk mail’ and talk about the things for sale.
Listen to simple radio programs or podcasts together and discuss the content.
Play vocabulary games such as, “what’s the opposite of ….?” and “what’s another word for….?”.

            Enhancing the School Years
For those with school age children, the Federal Government offers excellent Parent Engagement Research and Resources. They explain Australian Curriculum requirements and how to ensure your child reaches those goals.
            
            Creating a Mathematics Toolkit, for example, can enhance the ability of young learners to develop strategies and shortcuts for solving Maths problems. This may include practice at:

Estimating an answer first, then working it out and comparing the two answers
We need five ribbons that are 17cm long each. 17 is a bit less than 20, and 5 times 20 is 100, so 1 metre of ribbon should be enough.
Using materials to model the problem
Hmm, we need to work out ‘14 minus 8’. Let's put out 14 sultanas, eat 8, and count how many are left!
Practising the combinations of two numbers that add up to 10 (1+9, 2+8, 3+7, 4+6, 5+5) and using those shortcuts to work out combinations up to 20
Counting by 2s, 5s, 10s and (later) by 3s
Finding different ways to work out how many units there are in a group.
Let's see, how many ways are there to work out how many eggs are in the egg carton? That's right, you can count by ones, or you can count by twos, or you can add together the number in each row.
            
            Joining their Journey
You can also enhance your child’s learning journey by being involved at school, where you become familiar with the environment and contribute to programs and social activities.

Haileybury’s Parents and Friends groups embrace enthusiastic volunteers who can help them to organise social events. You can also seek to join a School committee or volunteer to help with Sport, Music or other extra-curricular programs.

These activities are enjoyable and help you to understand how the School works, while contributing to the programs that allow your child to thrive educationally and socially.

        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >Haileybury’s extensive range of support programs ensure that all students have access to resources that target their wellbeing and offer extra education and assistance where needed.

Haileybury has launched a brilliant app helping members of the School’s First Sport Teams to maintain and improve their physical and mental wellbeing. It will combine the positive physical benefits of sport by monitoring wellness, fatigue, energy and injuries to ensure students are continually educated on maintaining a healthy state, therefore keeping them at peak mental and physical performance both inside and outside the school.

The app also enables resistance training and injury management programs to be created for students at the touch of a button.

Over the Christmas holidays, Haileybury provided 1300 Senior School students with a vast array of fitness training sessions they could do anywhere in the country, keeping them active and healthy.
         
            The Visual Coaching Pro app will be introduced in time for this year’s Senior winter Sport season in the First AFL/AFLW, Basketball, Soccer, Rugby and Netball teams.

After downloading it on their laptop, tablet or phone, students are prompted with questions about their physical and mental condition. Their responses then prompt continued education, physical and mental, on how to best manage themselves throughout the schooling week.

Questions cover topics such as sleep duration and quality, mood state, motivation, general soreness, and fatigue. For example, a student might be asked how many hours’ sleep they had and then to rate its quality, which can then be correlated to effects they may be feeling in other metrics captured.

Haileybury High Performance Coordinator Michael Odachowski initiated the app, which is based on wellness surveys he used to conduct via email over the previous couple of years.

The new system is much easier to access and collates the data so that he and Haileybury’s physiotherapy provider, Southern Suburbs Physio Centre (SSPC) can monitor the progress of students as they continue their Sporting season.

Mr Odachowski says the app will help ensure students are maintaining their physical and mental health and identify any potential issues so they can be addressed.

For example, if a student reported prolonged soreness, they might need to see a physiotherapist. The app could also identify if a student may need to deal with a lack of sleep.
